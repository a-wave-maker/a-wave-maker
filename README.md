# Very unique introduction

- 👋 Hi, I’m @a-wawron
- 👀 I like to code sometimes. And I'm trying to broaden my horizons and learn new things!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning blender, C++ and Unreal Engine ^^
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something at some point.

If you've stumbled upon this place, have fun exploring. Hopefully there will soon be plenty to explore :)
